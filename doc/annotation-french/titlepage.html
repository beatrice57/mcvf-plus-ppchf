This manual is indebted to
the <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/ppche/ppche-release-2016/annotation/"
target="_top">annotation manual</a> for the
<a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/ppche/ppche-release-2016/" target="_top">
Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English</a> (PPCHE).  The present
guidelines for historical French supplement the PPCHE guidelines where
necessary.  In cases of disagreement, the guidelines for French prevail
for the French corpora.

<p>
The guidelines for the part-of-speech (POS) annotation were written by
Rodica Diaconescu at the University of Ottawa in French.  The parts in
English were added by Beatrice Santorini at the University of Pennsylvania.

<p>
The guidelines apply to the following corpora:

<ul>
<li>MCVF Corpus, version 1.0, 2009
<li>MCVF Corpus, version 2.0, 2021
<li>Penn-BFM Parsed Corpus of Historical French, version 1.0, 2021
</ul>
