<h3>Filename conventions</h3>

The files in the MCVF Corpus, v1.0, 2009 retain their original filenames.

<p>
In order to facilitate statistical analysis, all other filenames
uniformly contain the following four pieces of information:

<ul>
<li>date of composition (or best estimate), with leading zero for any
    dates before 1000 CE
<li>text identifier
<li>provenance identifier - bfm, mcvf, penn
<li>genre - m(ixed), p(rose), r(hymed verse), v(ers assonant)
</ul>

For uniformity, the provenance identifier is included even when it is
redundant with the text identifier, as in the first example below.

<p>
Examples:

<ul>
<li>0842-strasbBfm-bfm-p.psd
<li>1212-eustace-fisher-penn-r.psd
<li>122x-aucassin-mcvf-m.psd
<li>1498-commynes-mcvf-p.psd
</ul>
