<h3>Known issues</h3>

<dl>
<dt>&Agrave; as <a href="pos/pos-main.html#dat">dative marker</a> (DAT)
    vs. preposition (P)
<dd>In the absence of a lemmatized version of the corpus, the corpora
    undoubtedly contain inconsistencies regarding this distinction.

<p>
<dt>(CODE {TMP:...})
<dd>Comments of this form are internal comments to alert us to difficult
    cases that we intend to follow up on and revise and correct if
    possible.  Normally, such comments are removed for publication, but
    for version 2.0 of the corpora, we retain them for two reasons: (1)
    as warnings to users of the unsure nature of the parse, and (2) as
    encouragements to report conjectures or corrections.

<p>
<dt>Comparative constructions
<dd>In general, comparative constructions are given a clausal analysis
    with a CP-CMP-DEG dominating an IP-SUB (generally with ellipsis).
    The corpus contains some relic comparative structures that are
    annotated according to the guidelines used in the Penn Parsed
    Corpora of Historical English (since replaced in the French corpus
    by guidelines that are superficially more complex, in the sense of
    containing more nodes in the annotation, but conceptually simpler
    and hence easier to apply consistently).

<p>
<dt>Finite IP without finite verb
<dd>The documentation allows finite IPs without a finite verbs in
    comparative contexts (CP-CMP or semantically comparative CP-ADV), in
    parenthetical and gapping contexts, and others.  Very rarely, an
    IP-MAT or IP-SUB lacks a finite verb in other contexts.  Because
    there are less a dozen cases of the last type, we have not adopted
    the convention from the Old English parsed corpora of distinguishing
    such cases as IPX-MAT or IPX-SUB.

<p>
<dt><a href="syntax-labels.html#indices">Indices</a>
<dd>The guidelines make a distinction between indices introduced by
    hyphens and equal signs, but the distinction is likely implemented
    inconsistently.  The inconsistency should have no serious
    consequences, however.

<p>
<dt><a href="syntax-main.html#nominalized_infinitive">Nominalized infinitives</a>

<p>
<dt>Preverbal heads of arguments vs. preverbal degree words
<dd>*ICH* traces associated
    with <a href="syntax-main.html#preverbal_arguments">preverbal heads
    of arguments</a> (as well as preverbal predicate nominals and
    adjectives) are dominated by lexical categories (ADJ, NCS, etc.),
    whereas ones associated
    with <a href="syntax-main.html#preverbal_degree_words">preverbal
    degree words</a> are dominated by the phrasal projection QP.

<!--
<p>
<dt><b><a href="syntax-main.html#pp-subcategories">PP subcategories</a></b>
<dd>As noted in the documentation, the annotation of the subcategories
    of IP-level PPs is imperfect and at least in the case of TRA clearly
    incomplete.  The <a href="syntax-main.html#pp-subcategories">entry
    for the topic</a> explains our reasons for retaining the
    subcategories despite the associated difficulties.
-->
  
<p>
<dt>Square brackets
<dd>Square brackets are encoded inconsistently as "[ ... ]" or as
"&lt;bracket&gt; ... &lt;$$bracket&gt;", possibly even within the same text.
