This manual is indebted to
the <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/annotation"
target="_new">morphosyntactic annotation manual</a> for the
<a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/" target="_new">Penn
Parsed Corpora of Historical English</a> (PPCHE).  The present
guidelines for historical French supplement the PPCHE guidelines where
necessary.  In cases of disagreement, the guidelines for French prevail
for the French corpora.  It is worth noting that for comparative and
degree constructions, the present guidelines are more rational, and they
will be adopted for English in the next release of the PPCHE.

<p>
The guidelines for the part-of-speech (POS) annotation were written by
Rodica Diaconescu at the University of Ottawa in French.  The parts in
English were added by Beatrice Santorini at the University of Pennsylvania.

<p>
The guidelines apply to the following corpora:

<ul>
<li>MCVF Corpus, version 1.0, 2009
<li>MCVF Corpus, version 2.0, 2021
<li>Penn-BFM Parsed Corpus of Historical French, version 1.0, 2021
</ul>
