Penn-BFM Parsed Corpus of Historical French, version 1.0.
<https://github.com/beatrice57/mcvf-plus-ppchf>

Contents
========

Number of words: 762,814 words (excluding punctuation and metadata)

Text encoding: UTF-8.

The PPCHF consists of parsed texts only.  323,040 words (42%) were
entered at Penn, and the remaining 439,774 (58%) come from online
editions published by the Base de Fran&ccedil;ais M&eacute;di&eacute;val
(BFM).

We retain the names of the BFM files (the text's identifiers in the BFM
catalog), but the filenames have been augmented to conform to our
filename conventions (see ../../docs/sources/filename-conventions.html),
even when this leads to redundancy.

Example:

* strasbBfm --> 0842-strasbBfm-bfm-p
* qlr --> 1150-qlr-bfm-p

Funding
=======

This corpus was constructed without external funding.
